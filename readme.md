Welcome to CNN-B!

I am a repository for Zijun Cui, Zhenhua Tian and Lemeng Wang.

I am an erudite and comprehensive CNN repository, based on Caffe and comprised of CaffeNet, AlexNet, and GoogleNet.

On CCV:
You should not trifle with me on CCV, unless you want to learn how mischievous and fastidious I could be.
You can allocate 2 high-performance GPUs using the command "interact -q gpu -n 2 -t 1:00:00", but that is far from enough to please me. I will not meet anybody unless they bring me a gift of an Nvidia GPU with a CUDA compute capibility greater than 3.0.
You may try your luck to compile me, but I shall warn you that the problem with gflags can never be tackled. Gflags can neither be loaded or installed because of the low level of your CCV account. How much fun that could be!
I know you would also think of using the Caffe module with CPU only. I can assure you, dear, that you can never break the shackle of "no CUDA-capable device detected". Besides, I have also disabled Cublas handle and Curand generator as a failsafe method to prevent you from ever succeed!

On your own computer:
